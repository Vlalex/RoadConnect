ChallangeHTML for Infitity Games

Usige of Cocos Creator (CC) and typescript to remake the unity game for HTML5.

All the animations are either made with the Animation system and the tween system from CC.

The system that checks for all the pieces rotation has been changed to accept the Angle property of CC Nodes and changed for a system implementing posible values for each posible rotation.

The coroutine system also had to be replace for the Scheduler system, it requiered some finesse.
